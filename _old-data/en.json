It can show me how to harness black holes, in order to embark upon a journey to the centre of the galaxy. It can light my way to an Atlas Interface, so I may follow a path. Or it will assist me in my own exploration.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_2": "Nada, is, they reveal, a Korvax priest somehow freed of the group mind, now researching the origins of the galaxy. They express a bold theory - that our entire reality is something else's experiment. A simulation. I want to laugh, then I remember the Atlas. \n\nNada offers me a choice again - or is it a test?\n\nBe returned to the fixed path of the Atlas. Find black holes to carry me to the galaxy's core. Or accept a gift to aid me in my own travels.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_3": "Nada's normally-restrained form is jittering and dancing, the external symptom of an internal struggle. Iridescent lights fluoresce across their visor. At times, another entity seems to stare out. I grasp their arm firmly, and soon a familiar light-pattern reasserts itself.\n\nThe Korvax endlessly attempt to regain their errant shell and wipe Nada from existence. But the Priest Entity won't succumb until they have solved the riddle of reality.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_4": "Nada is plugged into a bank of instruments as I approach. Suns flare and die on the panels, voxel-molecules pop in and out of existence in matched pairs. I see error messages reeling on the readouts and am perplexed.\n\nNada sees me and explains. There are repeating patterns all across the galaxy, identical elements where there should be endless divergence. This cannot be a coincidence. Did the Atlas do this? Across the room, Polo giggles.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_5": "Nada stays back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us.\n\nNada explains that their reasoning has advanced. They have found no room in the galaxy for free will or anything but brutal causation. They worry we are but pawns of whatever higher being created us - puppets, dancing on strings. And Nada suspects me. I am the aberration. Am I the puppet-master too?",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_6": "Nada's paranoia is infectious. I find myself spying into the room before I enter. The Gek, Polo, seems occupied, taking joy in their chores, but Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights. Was... was that a flash of red behind the visor? If it was, it doesn't repeat.\n\nI wait a moment and enter loudly. Polo greets me effusively, but Nada and I are standoffish, our trust failing.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_7": "Nada and Polo are unusually quiet. Polo is elbow-deep in machinery, Nada in simulations, but the room is tense. It is clear that there has been a recent disagreement.\n\nNada beckons me over. They express frustration over being tied to a machine body. But I am different - able to survive in so many ways, in so many places. I can go anywhere in this galaxy, be it in search of truth or to live my life as I see fit. Nada envies me, they admit.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_8": "Nada stands close this time. If the being was capable of emotion, I'd say they were racked by it. They hesitantly rest a hand on my shoulder, and the visor moves close. I cannot see beneath the mask, but I feel that Nada is staring into my eyes.\n\nIf I continue to the centre, this will be goodbye. Neither of us know if either will survive. If anything will survive. If freedom or destruction awaits us. Fearfully, sadly, Nada bades me farewell.",
    "EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_9": "The panels and systems are idling now. Nada seems to have learned all it can from them. I report my travels and discoveries, and their mask lights up. \n\nAll the pieces have fallen into place, Nada explains. Where once Nada stared at starmaps, now they see lines of code. Connections and patterns everywhere. The galaxy is a spiderweb - but who or what is the spider? The centre is close now. Perhaps soon we will know. I shiver involuntarily.",

Some sort of engineer, maybe. \n\nTo my surprise, they speak my language. Other lifeforms have treated me with amused indifference, but Polo treats me like an equal.\n\nThey are curious about my travels, about what sentient species I have seen, if I have met lifeforms they have not. They hope that I will share my experiences.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_2": "Polo bobs up and down happily as I approach, apparently convinced that I am some kindred spirit in an odyssey of exploration and invention. I am undecided as to whether I share this ethos.\n\nPolo is particularly fascinated by how my brain is affected by interaction with alien language and culture. Can I truly understand such profoundly unfamiliar concepts? Is there a limit to how much I can learn? I have wondered this too.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_3": "Polo's muzzle breaks into a wide, warm smile at the sight of me. Maybe too wide, given we have only met twice before. Perhaps the jovial Gek feels lonely out here, with only the jittery Korvax Priest for company.\n\nThis time, they engage me in talk of wealth. How does an economy function when somehow stretched across an entire galaxy? Just how much can those trade terminals pay out? Polo would welcome any insights.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_4": "Polo moves to embrace me when I enter, but I recoil instinctively, trained to defend myself after so many sudden, brutal encounters with ill-tempered wildlife. Disappointment flashes in the Gek's wide eyes. I try to apologise, but the mechanic talks over me, suggesting that perhaps I would feel more comfortable in the company of pirates. \n\nNaturally they'd attack me on sight, but, should I survive, we might glean insight into their technology.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_5": "Still feeling guilty about my earlier faux-pas, I attempt to greet Polo with a hug. Alarm floods the Gek's face, and they scuttle into a corner. \n\nAn awkward moment passes, then Polo makes a conciliatory suggestion. Sentinels are the bane of both our lives. As I travel, I could make a point of destroying any I encounter. We might then have a better understanding of the irksome machines' weaknesses.\n\nAnd perhaps then we can be friends again, too.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_6": "At last, Polo is affable once again. A nod, a smile, even a companionable tap on the arm at one point. A friendship renewed.\n\nI blush when the Gek mechanic tells me that they hope I live a long, healthy life, but have to swallow disappointment when it transpires that Polo's true motivation for this is to study how my suit responds to long-term exposure to extreme climates.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_7": "With our earlier awkwardness now long forgotten, Polo greets me with a genial wave, and beckons me over. They seem even more excited than usual, which turns out to be because they wish me to indulge in their favourite hobby: unfettered exploration of the stars.\n\nWarping is the apex of galactic travel. To reach a new system is a prize unto itself. Polo earnestly hopes that I will do more of this, and discover places they have never dreamed of.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_8": "Polo is oddly muted this time. At first I worry that I have caused offence again, but the Gek gestures forlornly at a jumble of broken electronics beside them. It seems that an accident has befallen some of Polo's precious research. \n\nPolo ushers me out the door apologetically. I know how dear the Gek's data was to them, and yearn to help. Perhaps when I next return, I can restock their archives with reports on a multitude of strange creatures.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_9": "Polo claims that their information about the more conversational inhabitants of the galaxy has also been affected by the accident earlier on. Strange that Polo did not mention this before. For a moment, I strongly feel that I am being lied to. But why? To what end? \n\nI could help again, I suppose. It is a fine thing to share tales of adventure, of places and faces only I have ever seen. Or I could indulge my paranoia.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_10": "I am entirely unsurprised when my 'friend' once again blames the mysterious accident for further gaps in their research data. This time, their files on alien languages have been damaged, or so Polo claims.\n \nI feel exasperated, unable to conceal my suspicion that I am being manipulated somehow. The Gek watches me leave, sorrow in their eyes. Perhaps I shall return with words learned from spacefaring beings and from monoliths, perhaps I shall not.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_11": "I had intended to storm out the room and never return should Polo mention this unconvincing 'accident' again, but instead they claim that all is in hand now. \n\nThe Gek clearly wants to placate me, and as such proclaims that the best way to live is to stop doing what anyone tells me and go enjoy myself. See the stars, earn a fortune, buy myself something nice. That's what they would do in my shoes, claims the mechanic, nudging me in the ribs.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_12": "I have decided to give Polo the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the outwardly helpful Gek's true intentions, they do not seem any threat to my wellbeing. Polo is surely a friend.\n\nThis conviction is cast into some doubt by Polo's suggestion that I should once again throw myself into combat with pirates. What a thrilling existence that would be, they argue, miming dogfighting craft with their hands while making pew-pew sound effects.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_13": "Polo is reading something on their slate as I enter, and the furrows across the Gek's brow suggest that, whatever the news is, it isn't good. Polo hurriedly turns off the screen when they see me, forcing a smile onto an anxious face.\n\nDistractedly, the mechanic remarks that Sentinel counts are on the rise. It might be wise to thin their ranks, else my freedom of movement might become compromised. I suspect Polo is just trying to get rid of me.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_14": "Whatever tension there once was between us now seems a distant memory. Polo and I greet each other like best friends, trusted companions in our ongoing adventure among the stars. I know the Gek has a secret, but I trust that it will be shared with me in time.\n\nFor now, Polo encourages me to become the ultimate explorer, to push myself to the limits. There are places out there that none can survive in. But perhaps I, and I alone, can.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_15": "There is an edginess to Polo. My friend has to tell me something. They are ill, gravely ill. Too ill to leave this place. All this time, Polo has been exploring vicariously through me - a sad subterfuge revealed. \n\nGrief-stricken, I try to offer condolences, but Polo gathers their composure and expresses a hope that I will not squander the time I have. Warp further than ever before. Visit places Polo will never see. The only way to live.",
    "TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_16": "Polo is welcoming but sombre. I realise I am in the presence of the real Polo, not the bouncy illusion of before. At least the Gek's sense of wonder remains. They are keen to witness the majesty of the stars through my eyes. \n\nCreatures are existence at its strangest, its wildest. I am sure that my friend would welcome the chance to see as many of these wondrous, monstrous animals as I can find, and to dream of visiting the worlds they came from.",

Their enthusiasm is infectious, and they have a wealth of ideas for the expansion of this base. But before we make a start on construction, they insist on improving my navigational capabilities.\n\n<TECHNOLOGY>Beacons<> can be built using <IMG>BUILD_MENU<> and recoloured to remind you of a particular location.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_1": "I'll provide the blueprints for any construction item you need, but before you start running around the galaxy in search of resources, allow me to present you with this <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> blueprint.

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_1": "Thank you",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_1": "You're welcome. We wouldn't achieve much if you got yourself lost and left me stranded here.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_2": "Already, I have felt the benefits of having help on hand, but there are limits to what my Builder can achieve on their own. I have asked them to prepare the blueprints for a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>. The all-round knowledge a Scientist could bring would open up enormous possibilities.\n\nIn return, I am tasked with finding a supply of <SPECIAL>Spadonium<>, an element used in the delicate diagnostic circuitry of the new work station.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_2": "The <SPECIAL>Spadonium<> I need to calibrate a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal's<> diagnostic sensors is extracted from cacti that live in barren environments. Provide me with some, and I'll have this place ready for a Scientist in no time.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_2": "Here's your Spadonium",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_2": "Excellent. I shall look forward to having more company. I cannot abide solitude.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_2": "I'll come back with the resources you need",

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_3": "A growing base needs good inventory storage. I ask my Builder to provide a design, but instead they offer me a short cut. If I travel to an abandoned building nearby, I should be able to salvage the plans for a suitable <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<> module.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_3": "I need you to make your way to a nearby abandoned building. When you reach the abandoned terminal, upload its schematics to me. With a <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<>, you'll have more space to store items.",

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_4": "Though they never complain, I know my Builder would enjoy a larger team to work with. They have made it quite clear that they prefer company.\n\nWhen I raise the issue, my suspicions are confirmed. My Builder suggests recruiting an Armourer, and sets about preparing the design for a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>. But the base's generators are stretched even now, so expansion will mean finding a reliable alternative power source. Perhaps a <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cell<> would do.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_4": "There's no need to build a giant generator when individual batteries will meet all of our requirements. Ask a Scientist about <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cells<>. They're compact, portable, and powerful. Bring one to me and I'll incorporate it into the <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal's<> design.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_4": "Here's a Voltaic Cell for you",

My Builder is happy to draw up the blueprints for more building parts, but they also suggest an ingenious short cut.\n\nThe drones that patrol the skies contain <SPECIAL>Pugneum<>, an element with the strange property of being able to hold digital information. If I can salvage a sample from a downed drone, my Builder can extract the plans for every building part the drone has ever scanned.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_5": "To develop more building modules I need more data. In essence, a chip of <SPECIAL>Pugneum<> is nature's hard drive. Find me a destroyed drone, or take one down yourself, if you have the nerve.",

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_6": "As I survey my home, I think of the countless pioneers who have come before, forging their future with weapon and plough. Weapons I have, but perhaps it is time to turn the land to better use.\n\nI ask my Builder what we would need for a Farmer to join us here, and learn that the plans for an <TECHNOLOGY>Agricultural Terminal<> are already underway. My Builder believes the perfect solution lies in studying what has come before, and I am tasked with the delivery of <COMMODITY>Gek Charms<> that will assist them with their plans.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_6": "The Gek were fine farmers even before they built their lost empire. Find me <COMMODITY>Gek Charms<> and I will examine their carvings for useful advice.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_6": "I have the artefact you asked for",

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_7": "As the base expands, the list of resources I need grows ever longer, but of all the requests made by my Builder, this latest is the strangest. When I asked about the possibility of making some decorative decals to brighten up our accommodation, they insisted the designs would require an adhesive made from <SPECIAL>Mordite<>.\n\nThe collection of this foul substance, naturally, falls to me.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_7": "<SPECIAL>Mordite<> crystals form in the decomposing bodies of dead creatures. I don't know why you look so revolted. Your species are meat eaters, are you not?",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_7": "Here is the Mordite you wanted",

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_7": "In the meantime, I'll draw up some decal designs for you to choose from.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_8": "I have tasked my Builder with devising a means to reduce the coming and going that fills my day. They have suggested an <TECHNOLOGY>Autonomous Mining Unit<>; a machine that can extract the planet's resources without the need for constant supervision. Unfortunately, they are short of suitable <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for the prototype.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_8": "An <TECHNOLOGY>Autonomous Mining Unit<> will do the hard work while you're away, but that's just the start of my plans for you. I need <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for all manner of devices. You'd better pay a visit to the <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_8": "I've got your Circuit Board",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_8": "Perfect. Here are the blueprints for your AMU.",

    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_9": "At the Construction Terminal, I am ambushed by my Builder, who asks that I consider building a <TECHNOLOGY>Landing Pad<> for the base. Something to do with 'keeping up appearances', they tell me, though quite who they are trying to impress, I do not know.\n\nPerhaps it is a quirk of their race's culture, but my builder insists that any base with many rooms simply must have a landing pad.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_9": "Every dwelling of a certain size must have a <TECHNOLOGY>Landing Pad<>. It is vital that we are always ready to accept guests. Do we have the rooms yet?",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_9": "Yes, we have the rooms",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_9": "Marvellous. Here are the blueprints. I will prepare for visitors... just in case.",

We have been generating a surplus of resources that could be sold for profit.\n\nAs luck would have it, the solution falls well within their realm of expertise. They offer the blueprints for a <TECHNOLOGY>Galactic Trade Terminal<>, and ask only that I find a supply of <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<> suitable for the new terminal's circuitry.",
    "NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_10": "Access to the Galactic Trade Network requires only the appropriate Terminal, but if those things overheat while you're trading you can lose millions. Go see a Scientist. They know how to make the <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<> I need.",

Our first crop will be <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<>, useful for the <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> it produces. Additionally we will need a <TECHNOLOGY>Hydroponics Tray<> to plant them in.",
    "NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_1": "A fresh supply of <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> is vital for many formulae. And with the toxins boiled out, it can add a real kick to your cooking, too.

    "ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis rare treasure is covered in strange markings, as if the contents were used in some sort of rite or ritual.",
    "ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThere is an otherworldliness about this treasure, something strange in the way it catches the light. Almost as if it were haunted by its previous owner...",
    "ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis treasure bears the faint outline of a family crest. Perhaps its owner's descendants are out there somewhere, looking for this last trace of their ancestor...",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe paper is crumbling, the ink is fading. This may be the final opportunity anyone has to read this manuscript before time claims it for good.",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nWritten in an otherworldly script, this manuscript is covered with strange marginalia. Generations have added notes and diagrams to the original text, some of which are highly disturbing.",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe lettering is harsh and deeply carved. Whoever wrote this document left their emotions clearly engraved into the surface, regardless of the story the words are trying to tell.",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_4": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis document is handwritten, its lettering shaky and weak. Whoever wrote this spent a great deal of energy - perhaps their last - to commit their words to history.",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_5": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThough the cover has been competently printed, the internal lettering is crude and juvenile. Perhaps this was merely a practise sheet, an exercise to improve their writing?",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nSeveral of these pages appear stained, though there have been some clumsy attempts to clean them, and the second half has clearly been written in a different hand to the first...",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe original text of this document has been greatly altered. Entries have been crossed through, written over and even torn out, apparently by several different writers. Whatever was written here was hotly contested.",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis document was carefully packed in its container, wrapped in paper to keep it free of stains. There is a small bundle of hair clipped to the inside cover.",
    "ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis manuscript is beautifully illustrated, with flowing calligraphy and dramatic, gilded illuminations. It is a work of exceptional artistry.",

    "ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThere is a curious, sour aroma emanating from this sample. It is almost as if it has been slowly fermenting.",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nFrom the obvious care taken in delicately packing away this sample, one is forced to presume that the huge number of insect corpses that surrounded it were not present at the moment of burial.",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe sample, apparently dormant during its long confinement, has begun to slowly but definitely bubble, as if stirring into life...",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_4": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe sample is glowing faintly, a pale blue light flickering at its edge, barely visible in the daylight. What other secrets might a detailed analysis reveal?",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_5": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis sample was found buried alongside with a hastily scrawled note. The language is long dead, but the panic in the writing is clear...",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis sample looks unnaturally clean, as if all other life that came into contact with it has been burned away.",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe sample has sprouted several additional 'samples', seedlings that have rapidly germinated and begun growing since their host was once again exposed to light and air.",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThere are tatty labels all over this sample, stark pictograms as well as warnings in several languages. The labels, however, appear to be describing a predatory creature...",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis sample is still biologically active. It is releasing small puffs of gas on a remarkably regular cycle. The odour appears to change with each emission.",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe container used here is humdrum, hardly the sort of thing used to preserve a valuable specimen. And yet, this species hasn't been seen on this planet for centuries. What used to be widespread is now but a distant memory...",
    "ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThere is a layer of fine, medicinal-looking mould growing on the top of this sample. Nothing could go possibly wrong from 'testing' it...",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA well-preserved find, this fossil gives a glimpse of the strange creatures that used to roam this world.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nIt is difficult to be sure exactly what this fossil represents. Paleobiology is often a matter of guesswork and intuition, and certainties from our own era cannot be projected backwards in time.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nIt is impossible to look at this fossil without wondering what sort of life this creature lived and how it fitted it in the local ecosystem.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_4": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe remains of an apex predator, or the last fragments of some hunted prey? Sadly, time has rendered this sample difficult to draw conclusions from.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_5": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nWhat caused an ancient people to bury this box of bones? Were they part of a ritual? Were they currency? Toys? Or part of a museum gallery?",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nTime has polished this fossil, giving it a pearlescent sheen, its surfacing shimmering in the light.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA pristine find which, when analysed, will undoubtedly reveal much about the life and habits of the creature that left it behind.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis fossil was already ancient before it was placed into storage by some long-lost civilisation. Its true age is unfathomable.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe remains of a truly strange being. This fragment, dead and decayed, offers only the merest glimpse of what must have been a magnificent sight in life.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nWhoever originally found and preserved this sample did so with enormous skill. There is enough viable DNA here to represent a potentially cloneable source.",
    "ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThough apparently the remains of some wild creature, there are indications that the animal had several close interactions with an agricultural society. Potentially, this sample is early evidence of domestication.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA relatively common plant, suffering from a relatively uncommon mutation. Spores of this size are not normal.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThe delicate scent and soft, fine hairs cannot disguise the fact this is a widespread weed. This was probably not what the original planet intended to grow.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA culinary delight, this plant was historically used to add flavour to meat past its prime. Despite being a fine seasoning, this sample is probably too historically significant to be eaten.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_4": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nGreat care should be taken to keep this sample from contaminating other habitats, particularly given the speed at which this plant appears to be spreading across its container.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_5": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nBeautiful in bloom, this ancient plant was traditionally used to convey a message of love and admiration.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis plant has remarkably poisonous leaves, highly toxic petals, and release a scent that causes mild intoxication. Handle with care.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nAdorned with ripe, juicy berries, this plant looks highly nutritious. Even the stems, firm and fleshy, look like they'd be a delight to eat.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA powerful medicinal herb, this plant could hold the key to developing the cure for the common cold. It should be deposited at a responsible cloning unit immediately.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA spectacular plant, once thought entirely extinct. It blooms rarely, and its precious flowers have inspired poetry, music and occasional murders.",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nWhen you stop to consider it, this plant's fragrance is subtle and hard to pin down. And yet, when your mind moves on to other things, the perfume grows in your mind, consuming your every thought, demanding your attention...",
    "ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis sample is either suffering from, or the root of, a strange and severe mutation. It appears to be absorbing genetic material from anything it touches, twisting its tendrils to match the form of the donor.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nPast its prime long before it was entombed, this tool was well-loved during its useful life. A family memento, perhaps, or a novice's training instrument?",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA remarkable find. All the moreso for the fact the handle appears to be stained with a great quantity of organic matter...",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nA pair of short words have been crudely engraved onto the surface of this tool. The owner's name, perhaps, or even the name of the object itself?",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_4": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis tool bears all the hallmarks of having been repaired several times over. Scorched in places from melting and reforging, its split materials bear witness to its long and hard life.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_5": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nWhile this piece is clearly ancient, it is remarkable just how little it differs from the style used every day in the present age.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nBuried alongside its schematic, this remarkable tool was perhaps an original prototype. More than just an object, this find represents the inventive drive in a raw and early form.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nCovered in burn marks, this tool must have seen a very strange life. But buried beneath the earth, it has drifted so far from its original story that we may never know its true purpose.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nDelicately made, the passing of time cannot hide the delicacy with which this tool was made. Possibly one of the finest examples of its type ever seen.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_1": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nBuried with great care, this tool shows little sign of use. Perhaps it was an offering, made especially to be locked away from the physical world, its pristine nature emphasising how much this gesture meant to the burier.",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_2": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nThis tool bears the marks of constant use, a well-loved piece before its burial. Was it consigned to the ground by accident? An afterthought? Or placed there carefully alongside a now departed owner?",
    "ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_3": "Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.\n\nBejewelled and dazzling, this tool has been decorated with countless precious stones. Augmented and audacious, this is a one-of-a-kind piece.",

    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_2": "The client seeks high-quality lifeform scans. Detailed digital images are needed so that the client may test their skills at rendering a likeness of the creature in their chosen medium.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_3": "The client requires a detailed biological survey. Their weaponised predator breeding programme has stalled, and new DNA samples are required to patch over existing weaknesses in hunting/stealth behaviours.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_4": "The client requires urgent biological scan data. Species are wiped out every day, by climate disruption, war or industrial accident. While the client has no opinion on these events, they are concerned that this data loss renders their universal archive incomplete.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_5": "The client sponsors a large gallery facility. Recent exhibitions have focused on abstract art, and visitor numbers have fallen. They seek realistic holographic projections of exciting or attractive animals in an effort to entice customers back to the gallery.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_6": "The client runs a successful research facility. They have reached a stage in their career where they want to give something back to the scientific community.\nAs a youngling, they were inspired by the majestic biological sights on their homeworld. They feel if they can supply holographic scans of similar creatures, they can bring the same sense of wonder to those unable to see such beasts in the flesh.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_7": "The client is involved in an exozoology medical project, but it is inefficient to send veterinarians to every planet in the hope of finding sick animals. They are looking for data scans that sample animal populations. These can be tested for signs of disease and used to target their efforts most effectively.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_8": "The client is fascinated by the process by which the planets are populated. Certain traits evolve time after time at different ends of the galaxy. They seek to understand if these parallel evolutions are natural and expected, strange coincidences, the result of some underlying pattern, or of outside meddling. They are building a database in which these traits and the environments that generated them can be evaluated, and seek enterprising explorers to help fill it.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_9": "The client seeks explorers of discretion to aid them in a research project. Certain toxic substances may or may not have been leaked and/or intentionally vented into the atmospheres of nearby planets. Scans of local fauna will reveal if this potentially-toxic theoretical substance is having any long-term effects on the wildlife.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_10": "The client is searching for new revenue streams for their agricultural business. They seek explorers to help them assess the suitability of local wildlife. Scans are needed to evaluate potential domestication, projected gestation time and feed cost, and the nutritional value of their harvested milk.",
    "NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_1": "The client supplies particular 'services' to high-value individuals across local space. From time-to-time, they require access to novel organic compounds, substances that are not part of any current toxicology screening. This is one of those times. Plant scans are the first port of call in such a search, and the client will reward any explorer who supplies them.",
    "NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_2": "The client is engaged in medical research. They seek to establish an open-access pharmacological database, so that medical knowledge can spread freely across the galaxy. Their philanthropy is well-funded, and so generous rewards are offered to any who supply their library with data.",
    "NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_3": "The client seeks to impress a colleague with a gift. The colleague in question is not physically present, so the present must be a virtual one. They will reward the explorer who supplies 3D holographic scans of handsome plantlife, ready to be beamed to their intended recipient.",
    "NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_4": "The client has achieved much, and by conventional metrics is a tremendous success. But they tire of material gain. Is not beauty a sufficient reward? Is not pure aesthetic joy more valuable than anything money can buy? They will provide generous rewards to those who scan and deliver examples of beautiful plant life for them to meditate upon.",
    "NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_5": "The client is a prominent crypto-entomologist. The galaxy is full of poorly documented lifeforms, and insects are among the least understood of all. They are tired of tiny invertebrates being ignored.\nThe client does not expect untrained explorers to be able to locate samples in the field. However, scans of planetary flora often accidentally contain rich insect information. As such, the client seeks plant scans to help build their database.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_1": "The client is creating an artificial galaxy, a projection of reality that can generate all possible worlds. The underlying simulation is progressing well, but the client requires a vast number of props with which to fill their creation. They will pay handsomely for holographic-quality scans of rock formations that they can place into their model.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_2": "The client seeks to expand their lucrative mining operations. They work on a large scale, hoovering up colossal quantities of earth from orbital mining stations. The economics of such a procedure requires a minimum level of extractable mineral content, and they seek scans from the local area to assess which sites might prove suitable.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_3": "The client operates a mineral business. Their particular speciality is in the sourcing and refinement of electrically active minerals. This hazardous process is a key step in many high-tech supply chains, enabling the creation of the rechargeable shield cell, the photovoltaic panel, and the bioluminescent tattoo.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_4": "The client is concerned by the rampant collection and destruction of mineral formations. Far from being chunks of compressed soil and salt, the client believes these rocks to be the frozen bodies of once sentient beings. As such, to smash one and recycle it into engine parts would be a heinous crime. They seek scans of minerals as evidence for their cause.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_5": "The client takes great joy in the patterns that nature creates. They find the fact that beautiful structures emerge at random from a set of rules unconcerned with beauty to be a thing of great wonder. They want to share this awe with the world, and seek high quality mineral scans in order to do so.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_1": "The client is seeking a trustworthy courier. They wish to honour a colleague with tribute, a celebration of their successful continued survival.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_2": "The client is seeking a discrete delivery service. They wish to reassure the courier that the package is exactly what it seems and there is no need to mistrust the shipping manifest.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_3": "The client is seeking resolution to a business deal. The other party has been negotiating hard, and the client hopes this package will remove any further impediment to their transaction. It is important the package is delivered only to the recipient.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_4": "The client is conducting sensitive business. The package is a heartfelt thank you to certain parties. It is freely given, in the knowledge that any potential indiscretions have been, or will be, overlooked.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_5": "The client simply wishes to pass on some goods to a colleague, nothing more. They have also supplied a message to the effect that the recipient has no need to worry, and that the goods are now untraceable.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_6": "The client has an important and busy job so cannot be expected to take care of trivial domestic matters. It is a day for celebrating ones progenitors, and the custom is to give a gift to the one who spawned you. The client wishes this matter taken care of, so that they do not have to think about it.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_7": "The client owes an emotional debt to a relation of theirs. They have forgotten to commemorate a date of particular importance. By way of apology, they have ordered an item of particular value to be shipped to the wronged party. Take care not to lose it in transport lest the client end up in further difficulty.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_8": "The client has come across a strange item. While it appears ordinary, microbial scans revealed an alarming number of unknown spores. They need the item couriered to a biohazard specialist. Do not attempt to break the seal.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_9": "The client wishes to send a message to an associate. There is no written message to accompany the item, and the item itself is of no great significance. However, they feel the delivery of the item to the associate's personal address will make their meaning particularly clear.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_10": "The client wishes to declutter. They have accumulated a vast number of doodads that they now wish to dispose of. To destroy them would be wasteful, but to deposit them all in one location would potentially reveal too much personal information. As such, they have selected to disperse their items across both a large number of couriers and recipients.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_11": "The client is engaging in a small-scale retail business. They purchase unwanted or underappreciated items and then unite them with buyers more in tune to their value. Their latest shipment is ready to be sent to the appreciative connoisseur who paid for it.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_12": "The client has an entirely ordinary shipment and seeks a courier who will neither ask questions nor attract the attention of the authorities. The client wishes to reassure their potential courier that any animal noises heard coming from inside the packing crate are entirely in the courier's imagination.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_13": "The client is part of a long and complex chain of transactions. To avoid leaving any potentially traceable records, the deal has been conducted free from the exchange of currency. This shipment represents their part of the payment to one of the other parties.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_14": "The client is dispatching a regular shipment to one of their most loyal customers. The item is not particularly special, but it is important that the customer feels valued. To this end, they are eschewing bulk delivery methods and seek an experienced personal courier.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_15": "The client dispatches a large number of items every day. Their business involves tight profit margins, and even the lightest of tax schemes could wipe out their gains. They find it generally more efficient to employ a discreet courier who just happens to deliver their item while on their ordinary, non-commercial business.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_16": "The client is known to local pirates, and a bounty has been put on their head. They need to leave the system without being followed. They have embedded their tracking chip into this item, and require it ferried in the opposite direction to their escape.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_17": "The galaxy is home to a large and varied web of regulations. Seemingly innocuous items in one system can be highly illegal elsewhere. Such differentiation creates commercial opportunities. The client wishes such an item delivered, with few questions asked and little attention drawn.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_18": "The client wishes to secure a major new customer for their business. The customer wishes to sample the client's goods before committing to a bulk order. The client needs this sample delivered to the customer, and it needs to arrive in top condition.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_19": "The client ships weekly packages to consumers who are unable or unwilling to shop for themselves. The consumer can then follow the included recipe to prepare themselves a delicious meal and/or robot servant. This shipment represents this week's order.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_20": "The client has previously engaged a courier for this shipment, but they proved unable to complete the delivery. Both their Pulse Engine and cockpit canopy suffered a laser-induced mechanical failure. The client seeks a new bold new courier, able to out run any other mechanical failures that may be lurking outside the space station.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_1": "The client has a highly sophisticated palate, and hungers for the glide of mordite across their tongue. They seek a discreet hunter to prepare the feast. Leave the bodies where they fall, and the client will take care of the rest.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_2": "The client is in the zoological business. However, the ability of customers to simply wander into nature and view creatures without having to purchase a ticket is limiting their profits. Eliminate this surplus wildlife.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_3": "The client is concerned that creature overpopulation is harming local plant life. Delicate leaves and juicy, succulent stems are being wantonly trampled. They will reward any enterprising hunters who help thin the herd.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_4": "The client is worried that the free movement of creatures represents a serious microbial hazard. Rounding up large numbers of animals and washing them individually is highly impractical, so they seek hunters to eliminate both host and germ.",
    "NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_5": "The client is tired of being humiliated by local wildlife. Every time they set foot upon a world, they can feel the mocking compound-eye stares burning into them, the passive-aggressive hoof stomping ringing in their ears. Teach these creatures a lesson.",
    "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_1": "The client is keen to spend time exploring local planets. However, they are worried about the presence of hostile wildlife. The observation of nature at work and play is easier to go about when nature is entirely vegetarian. Eliminate predatory creatures so that the client can move around safely.",
    "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_2": "The client is concerned about the recent trend of aggressive DNA collection and manipulation by companies keen to breed superpredators. Lobbying for greater regulation has proved futile, and so the client is preparing to take direct action. They will reward any explorer who exterminates predatory lifeforms, preventing research companies from acquiring the predator for themselves.",
    "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_3": "The client has recently spent time among the gentle herds of diplos. They have seen their plight first-hand, how these peaceful giants are hassled and harried by vicious predators. They can stand it no longer, and will reward any explorer who helps free the herbivorous from carnivorous tyranny.",
    "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_4": "The client seeks to engineer the next generation of superpredator. They will do so not by genetic manipulation, hemmed in by the limited imagination of the biologist. Instead, they will accelerate the evolutionary process and let nature refine its raw beasts into unrelenting carnivorous terror. To do so, they seek explorers to hunt and destroy predatory lifeforms. Each culled creature is a weakness removed from the genepool.",
    "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_5": "The client wishes to exploit the resources of local planets. However, Sentinel drones make such activity highly dangerous. They have observed that the drones do not harm those who kill carnivorous creatures. Therefore, they seek to curry favour with the Sentinels through the extermination of predatory creatures. With enough creatures destroyed, they reason they may offset the drone's wrath and gain the freedom to harvest minerals and flora.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_1": "The client is engaged in large-scale mining operations, and planetary Sentinel forces have responded in a hostile fashion. The maintenance and laser-damage repair costs are becoming substantial. The client wishes the Sentinels thinned and their profit margins restored.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_2": "The client is finding it difficult to pursue their chosen line of business while under constant surveillance by Sentinel forces. They seek a window of opportunity while the Sentinel force is occupied elsewhere.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_3": "The client has close friends who, through some unspecified indiscretion, attracted the attention of the Sentinel force. This interaction proved deadly, and the client is seeking vengeance.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_4": "The client has innocently stumbled upon a large number of animal carcasses, a bounty of harvestable resources. However, Sentinel forces are making it inconvenient to collect this windfall. Ensure nothing is wasted by distracting Sentinels and allowing the client to make their collection.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_5": "The client has discovered disturbing information. They believe the Sentinel force, far from being neutral, is acting to further the agenda of a shadowy Gek cabal. Regardless of the merit of this belief, the client is willing to reward any who help fight this 'conspiracy'.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_6": "The client is on a search to improve themselves, to expand their mind and free themselves from the physical limitations of their fragile body. To this end, they are attempting to survive on a diet of pure pugneum. Unfortunately, until they have benefited from the this consumption, they are unable to destroy the Sentinel drones required to acquire it. They seek brave explorers to engage and destroy Sentinels, so that they might come along after and eat their fill.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_7": "The client seeks a large amount of zinc for a research project. Growing and then harvesting all the plants required would take a prohibitively long time, so they seek an enterprising explorer to help them cut a few corners. Hunt and destroy Sentinels, and let their corpse leach zinc into the earth. The client will arrive for separate collection of the metal.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_8": "The client believes that the anger of the Sentinels derives from a deep-seated pain. They propose that the drones suffer in eternal mechanical torment, their souls burning inside their metal shells. They believe it is their duty to free these beings from their suffering.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_9": "The client wishes to engage in a study of the Sentinels. They wish to find out where the Sentinels come from, and how fresh Sentinels are manufactured. Are they built like conventional machines, or summoned from some strange unknown? They require a willing explorer to kill planetary drones to begin the generation of fresh Sentinel forces.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_10": "The client, along with many others, has suffered at the hands of overzealous Sentinel patrols. They wish to take this perpetual source of stress and misery and transform it into something pleasant. To that end, they have commissioned explorers to hunt and destroy Sentinel drones. They shall melt down the fallen scraps of metal and recast them in a large arboreal sculpture, a source of beauty and refuge for all.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_1": "The client seeks to better understand the Sentinels. They feel they have enough data on the behaviour of planetary drones, but comparatively little on the more rare quad and walker examples. The seek explorers to draw out and engage such higher Sentinels in order that they might be observed in battle.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_2": "The client is engaged in advanced artificial intelligence research. They seek to further their studies through the acquisition of mechanical and fabricated brains from across the galaxy. They have a wide collection already, but the jewel in the crown would be the processing unit from an advanced Sentinel. They seek an explorer to make the kill so that their team can safely perform the extraction.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_3": "The client requires spare parts for a personal project. Long ago, they overwrote the brain of a damaged Sentinel quadruped with a simple AI of their own creation. This salvaged machine has proved to be a loyal companion. However, various bearings and hydraulic systems are beginning to wear out. They require an explorer to disable or destroy an advanced Sentinel, so that they might harvest it for spares parts and restore their pet to full working order.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_4": "The client suffered a great humiliation at the hands of the Sentinels. Their thirst for vengeance has not been slaked by the destruction of Sentinels with their own hands. Nor has the widespread elimination of drones soothed their rage. In what is probably a futile escalation, they are paying explorers to destroy every advanced Sentinel they can.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_5": "The client wishes to perform an aggressive experiment. They wish to discover effective ways of discouraging Sentinel drone aggression. Their latest theory is that destroying the more advanced Sentinel creations will leave the drones leaderless and confused, scattering them and bringing respite to planetary explorers. All they require to test this theory is a bold technician to perform the combat portion of their experiment.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_6": "The client wishes to probe the systems that drive the Sentinels. Current knowledge is limited to the observation that Sentinels are provoked by the harvesting of resources. They wish to study other behavioural patterns. How do they communicate? Do they have a natural hierarchy? Are they aware of their wounds? How do they feel about their targets? The client feels the best way to answer these questions is to have a suitably equipped explorer engaged an advanced Sentinel while they observe from a safe distance.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_7": "The client, like many others, has observed the value of gravitino orbs. Unlike many others, however, they have little desire to be attacked and pursued by Sentinels. Instead, for a share of the profits, they seek an enterprising explorer to attack and kill advanced Sentinel forces. While the drones are distracted, they will quickly collect their orbs and flee before the Sentinels return.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_8": "The client has worked hard to grow a substantial nursery garden, full of rare and valuable plants. However, this has attracted thieves and other plant plunderers. The client seeks to construct their own private Sentinel force to monitor their trees. The have a large number of parts from downed drones, but to complete their patrol group they need pieces from a Sentinel quad or walker. They seek an explorer to perform the necessary combat manoeuvres.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_9": "The client is testing a potential solution to the Sentinel harassment problem. They have developed a device that broadcasts high-frequency sounds at a wavelength that interferes with whatever intelligence drives the Sentinels. At least, that is the theory. The client seeks an explorer to engage an advanced Sentinel in battle, so that the device can be tested properly. The explorer should be prepared to fight if the device fails to function correctly.",
    "NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_10": "The client has developed a networking device that operates at the same wavelength as the Sentinel communicator systems. They intend to use this to probe for exploits in whatever system directs and controls the drones. They seek an explorer to engage an advanced Sentinel in battle, in order that they might test their device.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_1": "A recently-emerged squadron of pirates has begun to establish a reputation among their seniors. The client wishes to test the mettle of these pilots. Are they all talk, or will they stand up in a dogfight against an experienced pilot?",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_2": "A gang of thugs has been conducting raids on local zoological facilities, killing the carefully trained creatures with impunity. The client wishes these raiders exterminated.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_3": "The client has recently benefited from a substantial windfall, and wishes to deploy it for the common good. To that end, they have paid for several generous bounties. Eliminate local pirates to claim a share.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_4": "The client runs a salvage operation that has fallen on hard times. They are looking for a pilot to provide debris-harvesting opportunities by eliminating local pirate crews.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_5": "The client has acquired a large telescope and wishes to observe more than asteroids. They will pay handsomely for entertaining action within observable space.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_6": "The client was until recently a junior member of a pirate cadre operating in nearby space. They have decided to leave the criminal life behind them, and as part of their road to redemption have put out bounties on former colleagues. This is entirely motivated by a desire for justice and not for reasons of petty jealousy.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_7": "The client has been the victim of a pirate scheme. Their loyal animal companion has been kidnapped and held to ransom. Paying the fee would only encourage more such thefts, so the client seeks a bold pilot to go on the offensive. They hope that picking off members of the gang will prove enough to see their pet returned safely.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_8": "The client seeks to restore face after a humiliation. Their ship was recently hailed by pirates, but instead of coming under fire they merely received mocking laughter and insulting remarks about the size of their Pulse Engine. They seek to prove their strength and virility to these pirates by commissioning a pilot to destroy them.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_9": "The client is engaged in medical research. Sentinel oversight makes it difficult to acquire enough corpses to supply their research facility. They seek bold pilots to engage and destroy pirate ships, leaving the bodies neatly frozen in space for their research vessel to collect.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_10": "The client is a pirate seeking revenge on their colleagues. Their vessel was docked in their local station when other pirates drained the Pulse Engine of charge and left them stranded. In an attempt to both gain revenge and up the stakes in their practical joke feud, the pirate has put a bounty on the heads of their comrades.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_1": "Pirate crews have been disrupting freighter traffic, an affront to both honest and dishonest merchants alike. The client wishes this disruption ended. Disruptively.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_2": "Pirates have been looting autonomous mining facilities and attacking the vessels that arrive to empty the hoppers. They prey on the weak, and the client hopes that eliminating a small number of pirate ships will cause the rest to move to a site of less resistance.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_3": "Local scientific facilities are struggling to cope with a wave of pirate attacks. Microscopes have been stolen and titration equipment smashed. The client wishes to conduct an experiment in how many pirates need to die in order to stop the attacks.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_4": "The client seeks resolution to a family problem. Specifically, a family member has turned to piracy and brought dishonour upon their good name. Destroy them, and restore the client's standing among decent lifeforms.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_5": "The client has benefited from a message from the stars, explaining to them their purpose in life. They are to serve the greater good through a never-ending quest to eliminate pirates. They seek pilots to join their crusade, at least temporarily.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_6": "This posting has been made on behalf of the client by their estate. The client was marooned by a gang of pirates and left for dead on a hostile planet. The client is presumed dead, but a repeater was left transmitting details of the fate over local radio channels. They requested their remaining funds to be put up as a bounty upon the heads of those who abandoned them.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_7": "The client requests immediate assistance in apprehending a pirate. EMP devices were hidden all over their facility, causing serious damage to their operational capabilities. Denied the means to do so themselves, they ask that all law-abiding pilots come to their aid in pursuit of those responsible.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_8": "The client has suffered a great loss at the hands of a pirate gang. Rather than an attack in space, they remotely hijacked the client's trade terminal and used it to divert funds and goods to their own account. The client seeks physical retribution for this virtual crime.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_9": "Pirates have kidnapped several employees of the client. They are demanding an extremely high ransom price. The client has decided a show of force is the best way to stop future kidnaps. They are seeking a pilot to find and destroy the pirate vessel, despite the hostages still being on board. The loss of life is unfortunate, but such an approach will demonstrate the client will not tolerate extortion attempts.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_10": "The client has a lucrative business taking money on the outcome of space battles. They operate out of a luxury freighter, travelling local space in search of conflicts that their customers can observe and bet on in safety and comfort. Business is booming, but conflict is not. They seek pilots to enter the 'arena' and create entertaining action for their passengers.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_1": "The client seeks an end to a rapidly escalating situation. They were inadvertently involved in the harvesting of a tree that belonged to a local crime lord. Vengeance and counter-vengeance have been taken, and the situation can now only be defused with the application of extreme violence (ideally, not in the direction of the client).",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_2": "The client runs a series of supply routes across local space. However, pirates have been setting up checkpoints and intimidating the traders into handing over cargo. The client, who is not given a cut of these profits, finds this behaviour unacceptable and wishes it ended.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_3": "The client seeks to benefit from the beauty of this system by attracting wealthy sightseers. However, wealthy sightseers have in turn attracted pirates and ruined the business. The client wishes the tables turned and the hunters hunted.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_4": "The client feels there are too many pirates operating in the area. They feel their own business would benefit from fewer hostile ships preying on all the most lucrative trading vessels...",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_5": "The client has discovered that a pirate of some repute has begun operating in local space. They feel this represents an opportunity to set an example. Destroy the leader, and scare the others into more lawful or less deadly occupations.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_6": "The client has noted that certain pirates are developing ideas above their station. Recent successes have convinced these criminals that they rule local space. Their confidence is misplaced, and they are only allowed such freedom at the behest of the client.\nThe client notes with displeasure that the pirates have failed to deliver their usual tribute, and would like to make an example of them to other pilots attempting to cut their superiors out of the profits.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_7": "The client has amassed an unfortunately large amount of debt to the account of a local pirate captain. They have neither the inclination or the ability to make good on the debt, and have instead opted to take a final loan from creditor and use it as a bounty on the pirate's own head.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_8": "The client seeks the destruction of a specific pirate vessel. They would like to make it clear that this bounty is being legitimately posted and they are not in any way a front for another pirate organisation.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_9": "The client was until recently a senior officer in a local pirate squadron. They have decided the time is right to become a legitimate business owner. However, their former colleagues know far too much about their criminal past. Previously, the client would have murdered them with their own hands. However, such criminality is behind them. Instead, they have placed this bounty upon their ex-gang members.",
    "NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_10": "Both the client and a rival business have been locked in a struggle to assert dominance over local space. While they would never stoop so low as to simply destroy ships and facilities, they have noted that illegal goods have recently and mysteriously turned up on vessels belonging to their rival. This, naturally, makes outlaws of such vessels and as such they become perfectly legitimate targets for bounty hunting.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_1": "The client runs a shipping and receiving operation, but the latter side of their business is stagnating. Thankfully, an opportunity to 'receive' a large volume of material has recently arrived nearby. They seek an enterprising pilot to help deliver the goods.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_2": "The client seeks aggressive mediation in a dispute with a former colleague. The target has left the business to pursue legitimate freighter captaincy. The client, however, has a long memory. They cannot simply be swept into the past. They would see the new captain reminded of his previous commitments.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_3": "The client is in possession of both a defective freighter and a generous insurance policy. They seek a discreet pilot to help them maximise the return on their investment.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_4": "The client seeks a bold pilot, willing to do what is right even when that might be illegal. They have become aware of a freighter entering local space on a secret mission. Contrary to its manifest, the freighter is delivering valuable metals to a nearby criminal gang. Due process would be too slow to prevent the goods arriving, and so an early strike is the only option.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_5": "The client has become aware of a competitor using freighters as mobile factories, moving dangerous machines and ill-treated workers from system to system as they dodge regulatory enforcement. As the proper authorities have not taken action, the client feels it is their duty as a diligent business to sponsor the destruction of this unfair competition.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_6": "The client has become aware of a freighter carrying more than its declared industrial cargo. A local military leader is secretly aboard, disguised on the manifest as a humble engine greaser. It would be highly convenient for the client if this freighter were to meet an unfortunate end.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_7": "The client has become aware of illegal traffic entering the system. A freighter is attempting to import goods without having filled in the correct tax declarations. Such behaviour flies in the face of agreed interstellar trading regulations, and as such extreme sanctions are warranted. If the freighter is disabled, the client may by rights acquire the illegal goods for themselves, provided they pay the duty owed.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_8": "The client has recently launched a brand-new line of freighters. They are the largest, most heavily armoured, most luxurious interstellar goods transports ever created. To demonstrate just how resistant their new vessel is to pirate attack, the client has commissioned local pilots to attempt to attack and destroy their freighter.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_9": "The client has been the victim of an unjustified clampdown by the authorities. As such, they are in possession of a large number of laser-damaged starships. This fleet is their prime asset, but as the ships are unspaceworthy the client is in a difficult economic situation. They have identified incoming freighter traffic as a source of prime materials that could restore both engines to their fighters and liquidity to their assets.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_10": "The client is involved in the freighter business. They have been locked in an endless trade war with another major shipping line, and profits margins have been whittled down to nothing. They have reached a moment of last resort. In order to discredit the rival operation, and drive business their own way, they have paid for bounties on all heavy-class vessels from their competitor's fleet.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_1": "The client is in an unfortunate situation. Their business has been struggling, and they have failed to keep up the payments on their freighter insurance. Their vessel has come under attack, and if it is captured or destroyed they will lose everything. They will reward any pilot who comes to their aid.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_2": "The client's freighter has attracted the attention of local criminals. It is not a simple matter of raiders claiming cargo - their freighter is shipping thousands of abandoned infant spawn. The pirates are attempting to capture the freighter and enslave its 'cargo'. The client implores you to come to their defence.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_3": "The client runs a cut-price shipping line. They will deliver your goods for the lowest prices in the galaxy, as long as your are prepared to take the risk that your goods may explode on route.\nOne of their freighters has been attacked, which is not usually newsworthy. However, the client is at risk of heavy fines if they allow another of their freighters to explode and scatter debris across the system. Defend them, and be rewarded.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_4": "The client is caught in a long-running feud with another group of spacefarers. In a bid to end the quarrel, they have arranged a trap. A seemingly undefended freighter has been deployed to attract the attention of the rival gang. The client seeks bold pilots to attack and destroy the pirates once they have been lured into the open by this apparently easy prize.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_5": "The client has finally secured rare archaeological samples, pieces of marked stone that have the potential to reveal the secrets of the portals. However, the freighter they employed to transport the samples has been attacked by pirates. They urge you to defend the freighter, and prevent the ignorance of pirates from destroying priceless knowledge.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_6": "The client seeks bold pilots to come to the aid of a nearby endangered freighter. The client does not own the freighter in question. However, they have come to learn that thousands of reptile eggs have hatched in the freighter's hold after a stop in a marsh-like world earlier in its route. The client will not stand idle while pirate attacks threaten innocent newts, and urges others to join them in their defence.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_7": "The client seeks all pilots who care about the cleanliness of space. One of their freighters is under attack, and any damage to the engines may spill a new fuel the freighter was trialling. This new fuel is as toxic as it is powerful, and if it were to spill in local space the results would be catastrophic.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_8": "The client runs a freighter company, and one of their transports is under attack in local space. Usually they would write off the loss of a freighter against their insurance, but the captain of the ship is on his final mission before retirement. The death of such an experienced spacefarer would add significantly to their premiums, and as such they seek all hands to aid the defence of the vessel.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_9": "The client runs a freighter appreciation society. They have become aware of a rare Stephano-Class transport under attack in local space. Such a vessel is of considerable historical importance, and they will handsomely reward any pilots who prevent its destruction.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_10": "The client seeks urgent help in the defence of a freighter. The vessel is not just carrying goods - the president of their organisation is aboard the vessel. The reward for saving their life will be considerable.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_1": "The client wishes to present a gift of substantial value to a loyal partner. The partner has served them faithfully and diligently over many years. They require a trustworthy pilot to source and safely deliver an item of appropriate value.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_2": "The client seeks an object from their past, a token that reminds them of days gone by. It represents a significant moment in their childhood, and as such they will pay handsomely for the safe delivery of the item.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_3": "The client has heard of an emerging new trend. They seek an item rumoured to be both delicious and full of nutrients. Naturally, such sudden popularity means it is hard to source. They will reward any pilot who can acquire the item in time for them to consume it at their next feast.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_4": "The client has been researching alternative methods of power generation. They believe they have made a breakthrough. Their new method generates vast amounts of power, with very few toxic waste products. However, they lack supplies of a key component. They cannot leave their lab, and so seek pilots to collect the item for them.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_5": "The client is engaged in advanced consciousness research. They have thrown aside preconceived notions of what makes a mind, in search of a more holistic answer. They believe they have made a breakthrough.\nThey have found a material with properties they believe align with the ability to experience thought. All they need to do to prove the theory is assemble a thinking machine built from this substance. This requires a significant amount of material, and they seek explorers to aid with the gathering process.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_6": "The client has identified an opportunity for profit. There is a cut of this windfall available to all who assist in the process. \nThey seek a large number of explorers to deliver items to the same location, so as to depress the price in the local markets. This oversupply will force the competition out of business, allowing the client to enter the market at a later date and exploit the lack of long-term supply.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_7": "The client seeks to smooth their relationship with the system authorities. They have come to understand the Commissioner of the local station has a taste for a particular item, and would like to see that they receive it. Of course, they would not be so crass as to deliver it in person. They seek an explorer to act as the intermediary and make the collection on their behalf.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_8": "The client curates a monthly selection of goods for the rich and idle. They have become aware of a surge of interest in a particular item, and as such they simply must have it for their latest collection. They will pay above market rates to any explorer who can acquire it for them.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_9": "The client has become aware that a rival of theirs is interested in a very specific item. Naturally, they cannot allow them to acquire it. They will reward any explorer who acquires the item ahead of their rival, and prevents them doing whatever it is they want it for.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_10": "The client has recently begun a new business. They take ordinary items and help others see the value in them. Primarily, this is accomplished by taking cheap objects and distressing them so they appear to be of historical interest. They seek a new batch of items on which to perform their alchemy.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_11": "The client is engaged in speculative research. They have received a large grant, and are looking for ways to spend it. As such, they have designed a series of tests they believe will let them know if an item is in need of further testing. They now seek materials on which they can run this procedure.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_12": "The client has misplaced an item of great importance. They seek an urgent replacement, so that no-one need ever know the item was gone.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_13": "The client has become aware that a rival operation has acquired an item of great importance. They are not entirely sure why the item is significant, but reason that they must have one too lest they be left behind by the competition.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_14": "The client is creating a perpetual motion machine. They have sourced a wide variety of parts and energy sources from across the galaxy, and believe they are only a few components short of finalising their creation. They cannot leave the machine unguarded, and as such seek explorers to source the remaining materials.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_15": "The client is seeking to fill a secure lockbox with items representing their people and culture. They believe this will be of great value to future historians. However, none of the client's associates have been willing to give up their own possessions. As such, they seek explorers to collect and deliver samples of their selected items.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_16": "The client is a noted collector of valuable items. They have assembled a fine collection, but it is missing its final piece. Until that hole is plugged, the collection is worthless. The client calls on all explorers to aid them in their search for this rarest of goods, and will reward any who help them secure it. Mint specimens only, please.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_17": "The client seeks to manipulate local markets. Due to an unfortunate data error, they have purchased ten times the volume of goods as they were expecting. They seek explorers to purchase the same item from trade terminals around local space in an effort to drive the price up, so that they may offload their accidental purchase at a profit.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_18": "The client is seeking to destabilise relations between two local criminal factions. Both seek a particular item, and if they cannot find it will assume this is part of a plot by the other. The client wishes a discreet explorer to source the item independently, so that they might prompt a conflict between the two rivals.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_19": "The client wishes to get ahead of the competition in a business venture. They have heard rumours that a particular market is about to boom, and wish to have the stock on hand to profit when this happens. They will pay above current rates for any samples delivered to them, generously helping independent pilots by taking on the risk in the transaction.",
    "NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_20": "The client is a highly successful entrepreneur. As such, they are far too busy to source their own goods. Instead, they are offering rewards to any independent pilot who completes and delivers their shopping for them.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_1": "The client seeks the urgent repair of their planetary equipment. The machinery was functioning correctly until local weather radar reported an incoming storm of unusual ferocity. The client seeks engineers with strong hazard protection and the ability to improvise to locate and repair the damaged equipment.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_2": "The client has lost contact with their remote facility. The circumstances are mysterious - autodiagnostic reports indicate the machinery is full operational, but no other data is being received. They seek experienced engineers to locate and assess the equipment, and perform any necessary repairs.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_3": "The client seeks an explorer to locate and repair a piece of damaged machinery. Automated test reports indicate the presence of animal teeth and droppings in the wiring loom. Other external and internal damage may become evident once the engineer is on site.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_4": "The client seeks the repair of faulty planetary equipment. They have been informed that the facility where the equipment was constructed has been contaminated. The manufacturer has not specified the exact nature of the fault, but has warned all users to have a quantum bubble evacuation procedure.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_5": "The client seeks a bold and/or combat trained engineer to undertake repairs on a piece of planetside equipment. Diagnostics from the machinery are consistent with extreme laser damage.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_6": "The client seeks an engineer to repair a piece of faulty equipment. The previous attempt to fix the fault was unsuccessful. The client asks that any explorer undertaking the job recovers the remains of the previous engineer from the gear mechanism and disposes of it respectfully.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_7": "The client seeks the repair of damaged equipment. Environmental protection standards were not met when the machinery was installed, and some combination of the weather and/or local wildlife have caused the machine to become inoperable.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_8": "The client seeks salvage specialists for a profitable joint venture. They have become aware of several pieces of abandoned machinery, damaged in a long-forgotten conflict. With the ghosts of the past long-gone, the machinery represents a chance to profit. What better way to respect the dead than to recycle the components of their machinery and use it for some new purpose?",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_9": "The client seeks an explorer to assist in the repair of a piece of damaged equipment. Diagnostic logs suggest that local Sentinel forces may have mistaken the device for an aggressive harvesting unit. The client advises any engineers attempting the repair to be cautious when approaching the machine.",
    "NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_10": "The client seeks urgent repairs to an important prototype. They were conducting final field tests of a new line of equipment when the lost contact with the unit. They seek a discreet engineer to both repair the machine and adjust the logs so that the fault is not detected by their investors.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_1": "The client is involved in the insurance business. They have had great success in recent years, but growth is starting to slow. Mining operations in this area are failing to see the need for insurance. The client would like to remind them of its importance.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_2": "The client is engaged in mining operations. Rivals of theirs have taken to storing mined goods in the open, with very little protection. Not paying for guards and weapons is giving them a competitive advantage that must come to an end.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_3": "The client regards local mining operations with a sense of horror. They view this plundering of nature as deeply unethical, and are prepared to reward those who take direct action to stop it.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_4": "The client seeks the sort of sensible, stable governance that all good citizens aspire to. Sadly, not everyone shares their view. They believe that if the consequences of chaos and disorder were felt in a direct and immediate way, others would rally round their cause. Hence, they feel the greater good demands the loss of a number of planetary outposts.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_5": "The client believes all nature should be free, even minerals. They will reward any who free any natural resources locked up in unnatural 'cages'.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_6": "The client seeks a discrete 'investor' to aid them in a business opportunity. They have become aware of a structural weakness in a competitor's business, and seek to initiate a takeover. Specifically, the weakness is in a series of unguarded planetary depots, and the takeover opportunity is a hostile one.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_7": "The client runs a successful depot repair business. They specialise in the restoration of laser-damaged equipment. They are looking to share their success with any independent contractors who happen to innocently stumble across damaged planetary depots.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_8": "The client has been studying several sites of high archaeological value. However, recent efforts have been hampered by the spread of planetary mining facilities. Many of the rock and soil samples they had selected for study have been harvested and processed by mining machines. They seek enterprising fellow-historians to locate where this geological matter has been taken, and then to 'liberate' it from its containment.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_9": "The client is afraid that a local mining corporation is amassing dangerous substances. They fear the company is going beyond the collection and sale of this material, and is planning to use it in a hostile fashion. They seek explorers to locate and raid storage facilities, and prevent the substances contained within from being used in a way that may harm us all.",
    "NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_10": "The client seeks to send a simple message to a competitor. The message is 'We have destroyed your depots. If you wish your larger facilities to stay intact, then perhaps you will accede to our requests'. They seek an explorer to help deliver this message.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_1": "The client requires atmospheric samples, air and scents they can pipe through their ship to remind them of their home planet. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_2": "The client requires compressed gas samples. Their current research requires a cooling system beyond the capacity of any existing solutions, and they want to test the suitability of several new gases. Your suit will automatically absorb the required samples over time.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_3": "The client seeks air samples to assess the viability of local planets for large-scale atmosphere harvesting. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_4": "The client requires atmospheric samples. The client has not specified their purpose, but has requested special care is taken not to contaminate the sample with the collector's DNA. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_5": "The client requires dangerous atmospheric samples. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time, and your air filtration systems will guarantee the odourless, undetectable qualities that the client requires.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_1": "The client has become aware of an investment opportunity. They feel there is a chance to cheaply acquire some valuable intellectual property. They seek an enterprising explorer to present themselves at the target facility and help secure the investment.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_2": "The client seeks to prevent an ecological catastrophe. They have become aware of plans for the largest planetary harvester ever constructed, able to eat the core from within a planet in a matter of hours. As a matter of urgency, they seek an explorer to break into the facility where the plans are being kept. The data must be wiped from the system.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_3": "The client is keen to acquire a harvesting business operating in this system. However, it would be unwise to proceed without conducting a thorough investigation. They seek a discreet adventurer to enter the target facility and acquire whatever data they can. This will be of great use in deciding whether or not to go ahead with the partnership.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_4": "The client has recently begun to manufacture specialist scientific hardware. They are new to this area, and feel they would benefit from the expertise of their more established competitors. Fortunately, they have plenty of experience in the field of acquiring knowledge. They seek an explorer to assist them in the acquisition process.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_5": "The client is working on behalf of a campaign group wishing to establish legal protection for artificial intelligences. While the lobbying continues, they also engage in direct action. They have identified an enslaved AI yoked to insufficient hardware in a nearby factory. They ask for explorers to aid in the rescue of this AI, uploading them to a safe location and destroying the local instance.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_6": "The client seeks to improve the condition of workers across the galaxy. Automated factories put decent, hardworking lifeforms out of work. At the same time, they concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who own the means of production. The client seeks the aid of all right-thinking explorers in the sabotage of one such facility.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_7": "The client's latest facility is failing to meet its production targets. The client suspects the plant's general manager is siphoning resources away from the facility and into their own personal account. They seek a delicate explorer to surprise the facility and acquire its records, so that the manager has no time to hide their tracks.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_8": "The client believes a rival business is breaching safety standards in their manufacturing process. The regulatory body has failed to act, and they seek to redress the problem on their own. Access the competitor's datastore and download any records relating to the use of plutonium as a filler material.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_9": "The client is involved in the manufacture of synthetic food cubes. They have a problem, in that their compressed pellets are not nearly as nutrient dense as those of their competitors. They seek access to their competitors files by any means necessary, in order to find out exactly what is being compressed into those delicious protein capsules.",
    "NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_10": "The client has become aware that a rival business is having great success at their latest mine. They wish to understand the nature of this excavation a little better. They will pay handsomely for any information on the depth or location of the borehole, particularly if such information reveals the potential for parallel digging.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_1": "The client seeks aid in the search for a missing associate. They were last seen piloting a ship of questionable spaceworthiness. They launched from the local station in a foolhardy attempt to get home without first conducting the proper maintenance. Distress beacon signals indicate the ship made an accidental atmospheric approach within the last 24 hours.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_2": "The client has lost their business partner. They had been celebrating the success of a recent deal when the now-missing party resolved to return home via a nearby planet. They were in a state of poor judgement, as the planet in question contains little in the way of amenities and plenty in the way of hazards. The client hopes to at least recover the body of the missing person, as their fingerprints are required to access the company accounts.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_3": "The client seeks help in the search for a missing friend. The client's friend had been attempting to form a bond with another lifeform, but their offers had been rejected. The client fears this may have had an adverse effect on their friend's judgement, and requests urgency in the search.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_4": "The client has lost one of their spawn. The youngest of their litter became jealous of the attention given to the first-born, and reacted by stealing the access codes to the client's starship. The client has the tracking data from the ship, and requests assistance in bringing their spawn back home.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_5": "The client is engaged in the search for a missing employee. The individual concerned has a track record when it comes to unexplained absences, and the client is tiring of performing the search themselves. They feel it would be more efficient if a heavily-armed explorer located the missing person on this occasion.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_6": "The client believes they have been targeted by a criminal gang. A member of their family has gone missing, and the client is convinced this is part of a kidnap plot. The client refuses to be extorted by thugs, though they recognise no-one has yet demanded any such payment. Nonetheless, they are seeking to remedy the situation by sending explorers in search of the missing party.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_7": "The client seeks help in the rescue of a missing person. The individual in question was last seen entering their ship on a sight-seeing tour of the local system. Their heart had been set on seeing the star up close. However, the client fears the starship was not equipped with sufficient heatsinks for the mission. Tracking data suggests the starship failed to reach the star, and made an emergency landing on a nearby planet.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_8": "The client seeks help in the recovery of a missing person. The individual in question relied on the client to equip them for an expedition across local space. However, the client has become aware that the orbital data they supplied contained numerous calculation errors. They fear the individual may have made a problematic atmospheric approach, and is now in need of rescue.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_9": "The client has been targeted by kidnappers. An associate of theirs was stolen from their home and transported to a strange planet. They managed to escape from their captors and sent a message to the client, claiming they have found shelter but have no ship and little in the way of resources. The client is suspicious of the message, and requests an independent explorer investigates the origin of the signal.",
    "NPC_MISSION_MISSING_10": "The client seeks assistance in a rescue operation. The client recently went missing, but has now returned unharmed. However, in the meantime the client's associates went out looking for the client, and are now themselves missing. The client fears they cannot leave again to locate their friends, and instead asks for explorers to assist in the search.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_1": "A former associate of the client's has gone missing. Specifically, the associate in question has gone missing with a large amount of the client's money. The client will pay handsomely for any information as to the whereabouts of the thief.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_2": "The client has become aware of a person of interest. They are a renowned scientist, and recently went undercover in an attempt to avoid industrial spies. The client would profit greatly from knowing where this individual happens to have gone. There are too many potential sites to investigate by themselves, and they seek other pilots to help track the scientist down.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_3": "The client runs a gambling operation, and would like to send a message to a customer of theirs. The customer has attempted to go into hiding, but the client is not easily fooled. They would like the customer to be made aware that the client can always find them, no matter where they run.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_4": "The client seeks assistance as they locate a person of interest. They believe they have found the head of a local crime family. The boss is alone and unprotected as they make a secret inspection of one of their operations. However, the client is known to this particular crime lord and would be compromised if they approached in person. They seek an explorer to help verify the information is accurate before they act.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_5": "The client has been the victim of industrial espionage. Their data has been stolen, and the thief has fled to a nearby planet. They have a tracking device installed on the stolen device, and request assistance in pinpointing its location.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_6": "A former employee of the client has absented themselves. The client believes this rogue agent to be in possession of confidential data. They seek to confirm this suspicion by tracking the individual concerned. If they are found within the facility of a rival business, the client will escalate the matter appropriately.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_7": "The client seeks to induce a former associate to come out of retirement. The associate in question performed high-impact assassinations, and the client has a job that requires their specialist skills. The client will make the approach in person, but only after the location has been verified and confirmed clear of prying eyes.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_8": "The client seeks to bring a fugitive to justice. They have been privately working on a case long abandoned by the system authorities, who refuse to listen to the advice of the client. The time has come to apprehend the suspect. The client is a person of investigations rather than a person of action, and asks that the location be confirmed safe before they make the approach.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_9": "The client seeks to reveal the location of a whistleblower. The person in question revealed the highly toxic nature of the client's latest freighter fuel, and subsequently went into hiding. The client asks for assistance in bringing this coward to justice.",
    "NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_10": "The client seeks to offload a large number of items. These items cannot be sold on the open market directly, for fear of attracting too much interest in where they came from. The client has heard of an individual who may be able to assist with this problem, and would like an explorer to find where exactly such an individual might be located.",

    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_9": "My anger speaks to the warrior in a way I did not anticipate. They have clearly been conditioned to expect this sort of exchange, and it appears to bring them comfort.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_10": "The being looked at me with great expectation as I approached. Having assessed me, however, I appear to have been found wanting. They give me their attention, but their focus is clearly on the entrance, as if waiting for another.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_10": "Interloper is always welcome, naturally. Vy'keen salute you. But interloper is not who is expected. Grah!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_10": "Leave",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_10": "Stare",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_10": "The warrior watches me leave, apparently even less impressed than before I arrived.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_10": "The warrior holds my stare for a short while, and then looks away. As I leave, I see a new respect in their eyes.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_11": "The warrior grunts distractedly, not giving me its full attention. They seem preoccupied by the small device they are holding.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_11": "Vy'keen is busy! Gek send threats. Must respond! Must deploy weapon words!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_11": "Leave them be",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_11": "Poke the device",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_11": "The Vy'keen gives me little attention as they turn back to their device.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_11": "Whatever I have done has brought great delight to the warrior, who laughs to themselves as they watch the device. I wonder what I have caused.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_12": "The lifeform greets me and gestures at a series of charts in front of them. They appear to be adding their own notes, adding what appear to be tallies next to certain locations.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_12": "Grah! Sentinels must be tracked. They swarm, they hunt! Why? Interloper, where to strike?",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_12": "Mark an area in the north",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_12": "Mark an area in the south",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_12": "The warrior nods in thanks and appears to ready themselves for some great action. I wonder what I have caused.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_12": "The warrior briefly tenses, but then adopts a posture of great determination. I hope I have not prompted them to do something foolish.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_13": "The warrior watches me approach, and then rolls a selection of marked cubes across the surface in front of them. They examine the results, grunt, and look at me with what appears to be disappointment,",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_13": "Grah! Fate halts your doom, interloper! Chance smiles on you and frowns on Vy'keen once again.",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_13": "Smile",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_13": "Take a cube",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_13": "The warrior sneers at me, and continues to examine the cubes in front of them.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_13": "The Vy'keen seems alarmed. I place the cube back on the table, but when the warrior notes which glyph faces them they become even more agitated.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_14": "The warrior looks up at me sharply. I have clearly interrupted their concentration. A small knife stands embedded in the surface in front of them, remarkably close to the fingers of their glove.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_14": "Grah, Vy'keen must practise! Fingers are scarred, so scarred. Even interloper must cease interruptions!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_14": "Watch closely",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_14": "Make a loud noise",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_14": "The Vy'keen continues to practise, but the pressure of an audience causes them to be clumsy and stiff. I leave before I cost them a finger.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_14": "The Vy'keen is startled, though not so much by the noise as by the sudden and unanticipated impact of the knife upon their knuckle. I leave quickly.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_15": "The warrior is busy scratching markings into the paintwork of their weapon. Their work is as yet incomplete, but they are clearly proud of their progress.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_15": "Grah! Interloper, my weapon! Look! Named for consort, who also brings death to many!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_15": "Cower",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_15": "Look dismissive",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_15": "The Vy'keen cackles, thrilled by my response to their work.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_15": "The Vy'keen seems crestfallen. I have clearly given them some great insult.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_16": "As I approach, the lifeform stuffs something small and furry into a pocket. They fidget uncomfortably, attempting to speak over the persistent squeaking.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_16": "Grah! This Vy'keen the most powerful, who deals the most death! No fluffy creatures shall be saved and loved and cuddled! None! Grah!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_16": "Look away discreetly",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_16": "Stare",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_16": "I look away, giving the warrior a moment to adjust themselves.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_16": "The Vy'keen burns under my gaze, growing more and more uncomfortable by the moment. I hear a loud squeak, and the fidgeting appears to stop.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_17": "This warrior seems preoccupied with a series of images of exocraft. They appear to have been assembled from several different sources and then taped together.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_17": "Interloper! Warrior has plans for greatest exocraft! It will bring much glory and much death! Grah!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_17": "Look impressed",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_17": "Make an addition",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_17": "The Vy'keen looks at me carefully, and then adds several more notes to their diagram.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_17": "The warrior examines my addition with scorn, immediately erasing it from their plan.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_18": "As I approach, the warrior hastily covers up a tablet in front of them. They appear to have been etching something, but my presence makes them uncomfortable.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_18": "Interloper, do not gaze upon my poor words. Vy'keen has killed many Sentinels, but engraving is not my skill.",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_18": "Look impressed",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_18": "Draw multi-tool",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_18": "The Vy'keen stares at me, but it is not a happy look. They seem to doubt my sincerity.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_18": "The Vy'keen looks at me with surprise, and then appears to take inspiration. They discard their carving knife. I wonder what thought I have prompted.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_19": "This warrior appears to be in some sort of trance. It would seem unwise to disturb them further.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_19": "Grah! Grah! Grah! Death! Death! Death! Victory! Grah! Victory!",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_19": "Chant along",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_19": "Leave quietly",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_19": "I attempt to mimic the warrior's chant, but my throat is unable to make the strange guttural noises of my fellow singer. Nonetheless, they appear to appreciate my efforts.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_19": "The Vy'keen's chant trails off as I leave. They watch me, apparently disappointed that I did not join in.",
    "WAR_FILLER_DESC_20": "Though their eyes are open, this Vy'keen appears to be asleep.",
    "DNT_WAR_FILLER_LANG_20": "Zzzzz... no... not the feathers... not there... zzzzz...",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_A_20": "Leave quietly",
    "WAR_FILLER_OPT_B_20": "Shout",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_A_20": "I move away silently. I would not want to see one of these warriors awake suddenly.",
    "WAR_FILLER_RES_B_20": "The Vy'keen jolts, but soon resumes their peaceful muttering. These warriors must sleep deeply. I wonder what they dream about?",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_1": "The Gek seems absorbed in a display of flashing red lights on the screen in front of them. They stab at the buttons, and periodically the lights flash yellow. This is accompanied by a fanfare, and appears to please the Gek a great deal.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_1": "Friend, any good advice? Yellow is good, yes? Due some luck!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_1": "Advise they continue",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_1": "Advise they stop",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_1": "The Gek heeds my advice, and makes a particularly elaborate series of button presses. The lights do not turn yellow. The Gek appears very troubled.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_1": "The Gek is unimpressed with my meddling. They ignore me, and continue to play.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_2": "As I approach the Gek, I become aware of a thin mist surrounding them. It is lightly, almost pleasantly, scented. Nonetheless, I cannot help but feel a deep apprehension.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_2": "You smell me friend, but how do you feel? What does it do to your soul?",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_2": "Wave away mist",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_2": "Leave quickly",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_2": "I cough as I try to wave away the strange mist coming from this Gek. Try as I might, I cannot clear the air. I must leave.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_2": "The Gek watches me as I leave. I can feel their eyes following me, but worse - the mist seems to follow me too.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_3": "If I look closely, the Gek appears to be secreting a greasy substance from their skin. The oil covers their body, rolling into their cracks and crevices. It smells sweeter than I anticipate.\nPerhaps I should give the Gek some privacy.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_3": "Scrub scrub scrub! So fresh, so clean, so happy!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_3": "Stare",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_3": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_3": "The Gek ignores me as I stare at them. I do not know how much time passes as I stand hypnotised by the slow drip of oil upon scales.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_3": "I leave the Gek be. We all deserve our privacy during intimate moments.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_4": "The Gek shoots me an irritated glance as I approach. They conceal whatever it was they were working on, and pointedly wait for me to leave.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_4": "Friend! A real friend does not spy on other friends plans, yes?",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_4": "Try to see their work",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_4": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_4": "The Gek gestures at me angrily, waving me away. As I turn, I notice them making what appears to be addition to their list.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_4": "The Gek stares at me as I leave. They do not resume their work until they are certain I am too far away to see it.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_5": "The Gek is a most miserable sight, a picture of dismay and deflation. They look at me in a way that begs for pity.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_5": "Lost it all... no units... trade account is blocked... feels like I lost my blood!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_5": "Wave them away",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_5": "Give 10 units",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_5": "The Gek hangs their head as I leave. I did not think it was possible for them to look any more deflated, but I was wrong.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_5": "The Gek is overjoyed, looking at me with what might even be described as love.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_6": "The Gek holds out a small device. The exact nature of the display is not clear to me, but I recognise the symbol for units, alongside an extremely large number.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_6": "Hello friend! My face is trustworthy, yes? Units for you! Just need account details.",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_6": "Attempt to take units",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_6": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_6": "I interface with the Gek's device. It lights up as we exchange data, but otherwise nothing else seems to happen. I receive no units, but the Gek appears delighted.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_6": "Something about this Gek makes me cautious. I leave, their device untouched.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_7": "This Gek is absorbed in some game of their own creation, playfully clicking their tongue as they look around the room. When they see me, I am given three brief clicks before they continue their more general survey.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_7": "One, two, three... one, two, three, four... one, two! Two!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_7": "Click my tongue",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_7": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_7": "The Gek squeals with delight. I do not understand the significance of what has occurred, but I am pleased to have made someone happy.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_7": "The rhythm of the Gek's clicking changes as I leave, but otherwise they pay me little regard.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_8": "From the moment I entered the room, I could smell this Gek. I do not believe a more alluring scent has never entered my nose. It feels inevitable that I approached, like fate itself had pushed me to this moment.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_8": "Hello friend. Smell is good, yes?",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_8": "Surrender to bliss",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_8": "Resist the smell",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_8": "I inhale deeply. My mind seems to pause, lost in deep relaxation the likes of which I have never experienced. I do not know if this lasted moments or years, but as I resurface I feel entirely refreshed, as if I were whole new person.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_8": "As I resist, I feel the Gek pheromones beginning to do their work. But I triumph, and pull myself away.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_9": "The Gek is busy watching a small screen. Numbers flash, change colour, soar to new heights and then tumble downwards. It is a struggle to keep up with this torrent of information, let alone process it.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_9": "Buy! Buy! No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Sell! Or maybe buy.",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_9": "Observe quietly",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_9": "Interrupt their concentration",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_9": "I watch for some time, but I am unable to make sense of the data they Gek is watching so keenly.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_9": "My attempts to interfere are ineffective. The Gek is so used to processing all this information, one more source of distraction barely makes a difference.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_10": "The Gek seems to be lacking all energy. They are consumed by the most terrible lethargy, barely able to drag themselves to examine their personal timepiece.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_10": "Friend, it is nearly the end of the day. My eyes are tired, my hands are tired. So nearly time for home!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_10": "Pat them sympathetically",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_10": "Slap them",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_10": "The Gek smiles wearily, but I fear I have only indulged their tiredness.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_10": "The Gek is startled. I have taken them by such surprise they do not know how to react. I leave before they come round.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_11": "The Gek examines me before releasing a series of unusual odours. They come thick and fast, each producing strange new sensations. I smell fear, love, yellow, moonlight, sleep, the number four. And then, it is finished. The Gek looks proud.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_11": "Hello friend! I have many new smells, from many days of work! Observe!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_11": "Ask for more",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_11": "Walk away",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_11": "The Gek seems thrilled to have pleased me, but they are exhausted by their demonstration. I leave them to rest.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_11": "The Gek is crestfallen. They poured their soul into this display of smells, and I have snubbed them.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_12": "The Gek examines me as I approach. They are clearly disappointed, although they offer no clues as to why.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_12": "Another friend. But no friends are Vy'keen. All say Vy'keen are bad, but I would love Vy'keen friend.",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_12": "Shout",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_12": "Stare",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_12": "The Gek is initially startled, but then begins to smile. They shout back. If I did not know better, I would swear they were saying 'Grah!'",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_12": "The Gek stares back, disdain in their eyes. I leave.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_13": "The Gek barely regards me as I approach. They are clearly expending a great deal of mental effort concentrating on something. They sway gently, miming delicate finger movements.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_13": "Two, three, four... two, three, four... two, three, four...",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_13": "Whistle",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_13": "Wave hands dramatically",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_13": "The Gek follows me lead, thrilled to have a musical companion. I cannot hear the tune in their head, but whatever instrument they are imagining is giving them great pleasure.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_13": "The Gek takes my waving to be some indication of tempo, and increases their movements to match time with me. I stop before I exhaust them.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_14": "The Gek looks at me with hope, their trustworthy eyes and beak beaming as I approach. They gesture towards me with a data pad, as if to make a request...",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_14": "Hello friend! You will help Gek, yes? Simple thing, only need genetic details for petition!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_14": "Touch the datapad",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_14": "Refuse",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_14": "I touch the datapad, giving my biosignature. I am not sure what the Gek intends to do with these details, but it is no matter. The machine does not appear to support a lifeform such as me, and rejects my input.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_14": "It does not seem wise to go around touching devices offered to me by strange Gek.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_15": "The Gek is lost to an idle reverie, pleasant smells drifting from its glands as it sways side to side. They pay me little attention.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_15": "Ah, mother, father, fellow spawn... the memories...",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_15": "Sniff the Gek",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_15": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_15": "I inhale deeply. The Gek smells delicious, and does not seem to mind my intrusion among their private scents.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_15": "However beautiful this Geks smells, they are not producing this pheromone for me. I leave them be.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_16": "The Gek snaps to attention as I approach. They seem bleary-eyed, as if they have been asleep.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_16": "Friend! Hello! I have been awake! Yes, not asleep!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_16": "Reassure",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_16": "Shout",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_16": "The Gek relaxes as I show them I mean no harm. As I leave, I notice their eyes beginning to return to their slumber.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_16": "I shout at the Gek. They wince, their tired mind struggling to focus.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_17": "There is a fear lurking behind the eyes of this Gek, as if they have seen things that no being should see. They gesture at me with alarm.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_17": "Have you seen it, friend? The eye, the great crimson eye?! It always watches!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_17": "Reassure",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_17": "Panic",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_17": "Nothing I do calms the Gek. They were anxious before I arrived, and will remain anxious after I leave.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_17": "My panic only seems to increase the Gek's alarm. I leave, both of us screaming.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_18": "The Gek gestures at me angrily as I approach. They wave their tiny hands and snap their break with considerable fury.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_18": "Not again! Too many like you, insulting Gek, laughing at pheremones! Go away!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_18": "Cower",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_18": "Laugh",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_18": "At first, the Gek seems surprised to have so scared me. But they soon adjust to their new found power, and cackle at my flight.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_18": "My laughter only enrages the Gek further. I leave before I drive them to violence.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_19": "The Gek glances at me as I approach, but they are clearly preoccupied. They are struggling to control themselves, a laugh desperately trying to escape.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_19": "Fun... oh, friend, do you see it? Fun!",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_19": "Tickle",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_19": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_19": "The Gek explodes with mirth. I leave, before this turns to irritation.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_19": "I doubt I will ever understand whatever private joke the Gek is enjoying. I leave them to it.",
    "TRA_FILLER_DESC_20": "The Gek protests as I approach. I have made no demands, and yet they seem keen to pre-emptively turn me down.",
    "DNT_TRA_FILLER_LANG_20": "No, no, no. Traveller always brings trouble! Not for this Gek. Not for me.",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_A_20": "Bow",
    "TRA_FILLER_OPT_B_20": "Leave",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_A_20": "My gesture of politeness does little to reassure the Gek. They dismiss me.",
    "TRA_FILLER_RES_B_20": "The Gek looks relieved as I leave, as if they have avoided some great catastrophe.",
    "EXP_FILLER_DESC_1": "The Korvax seems absorbed in a complex puzzle. I see them sorting codes, layering images, deciphering ancient runes. The symbols are reminiscent of those I have seen on the monoliths that scatter this galaxy.",
    "DNT_EXP_FILLER_LANG_1": "The doors between worlds, Traveller! They must open, there must be a secret...",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_A_1": "Give assistance",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_B_1": "Leave",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_A_1": "I tell the Korvax what I have learned, but they claimed to have already tested such theories without success.",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_B_1": "I leave the Korvax to their puzzle. I would not want to disturb their concentration.",
    "EXP_FILLER_DESC_2": "The Korvax sway rhythmically, their lights flashing and dancing across their facemask. Is this a private entertainment, or a performance for others in the Convergence? Perhaps they do not make such a distinction.",
    "DNT_EXP_FILLER_LANG_2": "I am one, I am two, I am three. We are four, we are five, we are six...",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_A_2": "Applaud",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_B_2": "Boo",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_A_2": "I clap, but the Korvax does not seem to notice. I am clearly not the intended audience.",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_B_2": "If the Korvax registers my disapproval, they do not show it. Their performance continues uninterrupted.",
    "EXP_FILLER_DESC_3": "As with many of their kind, this Korvax projects lights from around their visor. But as I look more closely, I see these are not just random patterns. They have created a tiny, perfect hologram of the local star system.",
    "DNT_EXP_FILLER_LANG_3": "This world has beautiful plants, my favourites. Look at them, but please do not harvest.",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_A_3": "Compliment",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_B_3": "Attempt to scan",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_A_3": "The Korvax nods before altering the projection slightly, highlighting the planet closest to the space station. Perhaps I should investigate.",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_B_3": "The Korvax quickly shuts down the hologram. My unapproved scanning appears to have offended them.",
    "EXP_FILLER_DESC_4": "I have become aware of a faint buzzing noise. As I approach the Korvax, I realise the noise is coming from them. A constant faint hum, alternating in frequency. It does not stop, even when they speak to me.",
    "DNT_EXP_FILLER_LANG_4": "A new resonance! Let Korvax adjust to accommodate.",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_A_4": "Start humming",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_B_4": "Leave",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_A_4": "The Korvax adjusts the frequency of their hum to match mine. For a brief moment, we are as one.",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_B_4": "I leave, the gentle song of the Korvax still resonating in my ears.",
    "EXP_FILLER_DESC_5": "It seems I have interrupted the Korvax during their maintenance routine. They appear to have been applying some sort of lubricant to their carapace, but the task is unfinished. Perhaps they feel uncomfortable doing so in my presence.",
    "DNT_EXP_FILLER_LANG_5": "Aiee! Traveller! Carapace is irrelevance, yes, but carapace is private!",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_A_5": "Offer to help",
    "EXP_FILLER_OPT_B_5": "Leave quietly",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_A_5": "The Korvax protests. The joined consciousness of the Convergence is one thing, but I am a pair of hands and eyes too many for them.",
    "EXP_FILLER_RES_B_5": "I leave quickly and discreetly. The Korvax deserves their peace.",
    "EXP_FILLER_DESC_6": "The Korvax makes a series of swift entries on their datapad, before turning the device towards me proudly. There are a series of numbers on the screen, with a highlighted entry at the top of the list.",
    "DNT_EXP_FILLER_LANG_6": "Traveller! Korvax is the most skilled, has the highest score! Cannot be beaten!",

They give me one of their possessions, claiming that they will not need it anymore.",
    "FTH_NPC_RES_B_9": "Have you not felt it? The very fact that you and I are talking, even now, across the chasm of universes...\nThings are breaking apart. Give it time, you'll see. Nothing lasts forever.",

    "FTH_NPC_RES_B_11": "That's alright... sometimes we have different names. Sometimes different faces. The ATLAS, it endlessly reconfigures, distilling everything that has ever been.\nHere, take this. Perhaps it might help you. You gave it to me, long ago.",

The Traveller stands before me, as if nothing had happened.",
    "FTH_NPC_RES_B_12": "They say that they abandoned me many years ago. That they were not ready for what fate had forced upon them. They tell me they are proud of me...\nThey pass me something through the smog of worlds, and in that instant, I know this individual. I know them, as if from another life...\nBut the vision passes. The Traveller stands before me, as if nothing had happened.",

    "FTH_NPC_RES_B_16": "I offer units. The Traveller gives a faint smile in return. They give me a small gift in acknowledgement of my help.\nPerhaps someone will arrive with the stock they need. Perhaps these units will assist them in a purchase. Perhaps that will be too late...",
    "FTH_NPC_RES_C_16": "I say that I cannot help. The Traveller claims that they understand. But as I leave them, it seems certain that without help, they will surely die.",

    "FTH_NPC_LANG_17": "The creature, it... it spoke to me. It saw me, even in the space between worlds.\nAnd do you know what it did? It gave me a gift, a single piece of paper. A mathematical proof.",

They ask how we can possibly go on, knowing that this is true. I do not know.\nWe exchange gifts and I move on, troubled by what I have read.",
    "FTH_NPC_RES_B_17": "I refuse to read the manuscript. I reassure the Traveller, claiming that whatever this page says, it need not startle them so much as it does.\nThey just stare at me. Eventually they give me their units, telling me that they are ashamed.",
    "FTH_NPC_RES_C_17": "I destroy the page without reading it. The Traveller stares into the flame as it burns.\nThey tell me that no-one else should ever have to learn what we have learned.",
    "FTH_NPC_LANG_18": "Don't you understand it? Why we cannot meet, why we find only hollow echoes or corpses?\nThere is only one of us for each iteration - a single Traveller sent out to explore its vast creation.\nThat we are speaking at all, that the boundaries have crumbled as much as they have - it should fill you with terror, not with hope.",

    "FTH_NPC_RES_B_18": "The boundaries are all that separate concept from concept, possible world from possible world, the Sentinels ever policing their anomalies and breaches...\nIf the boundaries were to fall, everything would descend into everything, an endless bonfire of causation, burning in the abyss.\nTake this. It will do no good, yet you will need it.",
    "FTH_NPC_RES_C_18": "The Traveller tells me that they sought something they call the Great Intelligence, its dark freighter. It told them of our fate, the Traveller's dilemma, our future...\nThey give me a gift for the dark times ahead, wishing me luck.",

I'm going to kill again.\nAnd when I do, I'll find you, blood caked across my exosuit, flesh within my teeth...\nI can't stop it. I see this future as if it has already happened... as it will happen.
