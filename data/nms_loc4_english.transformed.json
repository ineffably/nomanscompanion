One night they sang a song, a tale of a lost people, of an armada of freighters fleeing the abyss.\n\nOf a world where every Sentinel turned against every living thing, annihilating them all within moments.

It is kindness that saves us all, don’t you think? Laylaps told me everything, speaking through my very exosuit! \n\nI will see you soon, my friend. Together at last! What tales they will tell of us!
