    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_4",

They are tired of tiny invertebrates being ignored.\nThe client does not expect untrained explorers to be able to locate samples in the field. However, scans of planetary flora often accidentally contain rich insect information. As such, the client seeks plant scans to help build their database."

  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_4",

Far from being chunks of compressed soil and salt, the client believes these rocks to be the frozen bodies of once sentient beings. As such, to smash one and recycle it into engine parts would be a heinous crime. They seek scans of minerals as evidence for their cause."

  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_9",

    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_16",

  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_17",

  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_18",

  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_4",
    "Value": "The client is worried that the free movement of creatures represents a serious microbial hazard. Rounding up large numbers of animals and washing them individually is highly impractical, so they seek hunters to eliminate both host and germ."

    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_2",
    "Value": "The client is concerned about the recent trend of aggressive DNA collection and manipulation by companies keen to breed superpredators. Lobbying for greater regulation has proved futile, and so the client is preparing to take direct action. They will reward any explorer who exterminates predatory lifeforms, preventing research companies from acquiring the predator for themselves."
  },

They can stand it no longer, and will reward any explorer who helps free the herbivorous from carnivorous tyranny."
  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_4",
    "Value": "The client seeks to engineer the next generation of superpredator. They will do so not by genetic manipulation, hemmed in by the limited imagination of the biologist. Instead, they will accelerate the evolutionary process and let nature refine its raw beasts into unrelenting carnivorous terror. To do so, they seek explorers to hunt and destroy predatory lifeforms. Each culled creature is a weakness removed from the genepool."
  },
  {
    "Id": "NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_5",
    "Value": "The client wishes to exploit the resources of local planets. However, Sentinel drones make such activity highly dangerous. They have observed that the drones do not harm those who kill carnivorous creatures. Therefore, they seek to curry favor with the Sentinels through the extermination of predatory creatures. With enough creatures destroyed, they reason they may offset the drone's wrath and gain the freedom to harvest minerals and flora."
